Notes
***************************

This is the implementation of MGTM, a geographical topic model using multi-Dirichlet processes.

The source code of MGTM is found in /sourcecode/nhdp3/ 

The topic sampler is found in Estimator.java
The parameter samplers in RandomSamplers.java
The model options in Model.java
The MisesFisher clustering and the Delaunay triangulation call in MF_Delaunay.java

A list of variables used in the model is given in variables.html

Example call of MGTM for car dataset kindly provided by Zhijun Yin from the paper 
"Geographical Topic DIscovery and Comparison", WWW2011 (the data are encrypted, the password is available on request from MGTM::c-kling:de):

java -Xmx3000M -jar MGTD.jar -dir ./example/ -dfile car.txt -est -L 500 -beta 0.5 -gamma 1.0 -alpha0 1.0 -Alpha 1.0 -sampleHyper true -gammaa 1.0 -gammab 0.1 -alpha0a 1.0 -alpha0b 0.1 -Alphaa 0.1 -Alphab 0.1 -delta 10.0 -savestep 5 -twords 20 -niters 200

Data format:
The first line gives the number of documents in the file.
Every following line corresponds to a document, using the format: 
latitude longitude word1 word2 ... 

Example file format for three documents:

3
56.3 6.4 this is a test
46.2 5.2 words are separated by spaces
65.3 12.3 that is all you need
